The Act received Royal Assent on 18 July 1947 and thus modern-day India and Pakistan, comprising west (modern day Pakistan) and east (modern day Bangladesh) regions, came into being on 15 August.[1][a]\\n\\nThe legislature representatives of the Indian National Congress,[2] the Muslim League,[3] and the Sikh community[4] came to an agreement with Lord Mountbatten, then Viceroy and Governor-General of India, on what has come to be known as the 3 June Plan or Mountbatten Plan.

[Configuration of Pakistan\\'s Constitution Assembly (CAP I): 69 members of the central legislature + 10 immigrant members= 79].\\nConsequences of setting up of the new dominions:\\nHis Majesty\\'s Government lost all the responsibility to the new dominions.\\nThe suzerainty of His Majesty\\'s Government over the Indian States lapsed.\\nAll the treaties or agreements with the Indian States and the tribal areas that were in force at the passing of the act lapsed.\\nThe title of \"Emperor of India\" was dropped from the titles of British Crown.\\nThe office of Secretary of State for India was abolished and the provisions of GOI Act 1935 relating to the appointments to the civil service or civil posts under the crown by the secretary of the state ceased to operate.\\nCivil servants: Section 10 provided for the continuance of service of the government servants appointed on or before 15 August 1947 under the Governments of new Dominions with full benefits.\\nArmed Forces: Sections 11, 12, and 13 dealt with the future of the Indian armed forces. A Partition Committee was formed on 7 June 1947, with two representatives from each side and the viceroy in the chair, to decide about the division thereof. As soon as the process of partition was to start it was to be replaced by a Partition Council with a similar structure.\\nFirst and Second Schedules:\\nFirst Schedule listed the districts provisionally included in the new province of East Bengal:\\nChittagong Division: Districts of Chittagong, Chittagong Hill Tracts, Noakhali and Tipperah.\\nDacca Division: Districts of Bakarganj, Dacca, Faridpur, and Mymensingh.\\nPresidency Division: Districts of Jessore (except Bangaon Tehsil), and Kustia and Meherpur Tehsils (of Nadia district).\\nRajshahi Division:Districts of Bogra, Dinajpur (except Raiganj and Balurghat Tehsil), Rajshahi, Rangpur and Nawabganj Tehsil (of Malda district).\\nSecond Schedule listed the districts provisionally included in the new province of West Punjab:\\nLahore Division: Districts of Gujranwala, Lahore (except Patti Tehsil), Sheikhupura, Sialkot and Shakargarh Tehsil (of Gurdaspur district).\\nRawalpindi Division: Districts of Attock, Gujrat, Jehlum, Rawalpindi and Shahpur.\\nMultan Division: Districts of Dera Ghazi Khan, Jhang, Lyallpur, Montgomery, Multan and Muzaffargarh.[10]\\nPartition\\nMain articles: Partition of India and Radcliffe Line\\nThere was much violence, and many Muslims from what would become India fled to Pakistan; and Hindus and Sikhs from what would become Pakistan fled to India. Many people left behind all their possessions and property to avoid the violence and flee to their new country.[11]\\n\\nPrincely states\\n\\nThe territory of British India partitioned between India (red) and Pakistan (green). The remaining unshaded areas were princely states.\\nMain articles: Princely states of Pakistan and Princely states of India\\nOn 25 July 1947, Mountbatten held a meeting with the Chamber of Princes, where he addressed the question of the princely states, of which there were 562. The treaty relations between Britain and the Indian States would come to an end, and on 15 August 1947 the suzerainty of the British Crown was to lapse. Mountbatten ruled out any dominion status for any of the princely states, and advised them to accede to one or the other of the dominions, India and Pakistan. Though it was technically possible for the states to remain free after 15 August, their dependence on the British government of India for defence, foreign affairs, communication and other matters rendered such freedom meaningless.[12][13]\\n\\nIndia\\nFurther information: Princely states of India and Political integration of India\\nLord Mountbatten continued as the first Governor General of independent India. Jawaharlal Nehru became the prime minister and Vallabhbhai Patel became the home minister.\\n\\nOver 550 princely states, almost all of the states contiguous with the territory of India, acceded to India by 15 August. The exceptions were Junagadh, Hyderabad, and Jammu and Kashmir.\\n\\nThe state of Jammu and Kashmir was contiguous to both India and Pakistan, but its Hindu ruler chose to remain independent (in status quo) \"for the time being\". Following a Pakistani tribal invasion, he acceded to India on 26 October 1947, and the state was disputed between India and Pakistan.[14]\\n\\nThe state of Junagadh initially acceded to Pakistan but faced a revolt from its Hindu population. India considered the accession of Junagadh invalid because it violated the principle of geographical contiguity of the partition, but Pakistan claimed that the maritime border of Junagadh is connected to Pakistan. Following a breakdown of law and order, its Dewan requested India to take over the administration on 8 November 1947. India conducted a referendum in the state on 20 February 1948, in which the people voted overwhelmingly to join India.\\n\\nThe state of Hyderabad had a majority Hindu population but also a Muslim ruler with a large Muslim minority. The Nizam of Hyderabad wanted to get Dominion status. Hyderabad elected to maintain its independence and lobbied internationally for recognition. However, it faced the pro-communist Telangana Rebellion and agitation by Indian nationalists opposed to its independence. On 13 September 1948, the Indian government launched an invasion of Hyderabad called Operation Polo. The Hyderabadi military was defeated over five days of fighting. With his state about to be over run, the Nizam signed the Instrument of Accession, joining India. The formal integration of Hyderabad into the dominion of India took place much later on January 25, 1950, when the Nizam signed the Instrument of Accession with the central government. A day later, as India became a republic on January 26, the Nizam took over as the Raj Pramukh or governor.\\n\\nPakistan\\nFurther information: Princely states of Pakistan\\nMuhammad Ali Jinnah became the Governor-General of Pakistan, and Liaquat Ali Khan became the Prime Minister of Pakistan.\\n\\nBetween October 1947 and March 1948 the rulers of several Muslim-majority states signed instruments of accession to join Pakistan. These included Amb, Bahawalpur, Chitral, Dir, Kalat, Khairpur, Kharan, Las Bela, Makran, and Swat.[15][16] The Khanate of Kalat initially elected to resume its independence, until 27 March 1948 when its ruler acceded to Pakistan.\\n\\nRepeal\\nThe Indian Independence Act was subsequently repealed in Article 395 of the Constitution of India and in Article 221 of the Constitution of Pakistan of 1956,[17] both constitutions being intended to bring about greater independence for the new states. Although under British law, the new constitutions did not have the legal authority to repeal the Act, the repeal was intended to establish them as independent legal systems based only on home-grown legislation.[18] The Act has not been repealed in the United Kingdom, where it still has an effect, although some sections of it have been repealed.'"
