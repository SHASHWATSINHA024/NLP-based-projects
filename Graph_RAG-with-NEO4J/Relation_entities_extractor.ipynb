              "'The James Bond series focuses on the titular character, a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming\\'s death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is With a Mind to Kill by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2022. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.\\n\\nThe character—also known by the code number 007 (pronounced \"double-oh-seven\")—has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are one of the longest continually running film series and have grossed over US$7.04 billion in total at the box office, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in 1962 with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of 2021, there have been twenty-five films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, No Time to Die (2021), stars Daniel Craig in his fifth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent Bond film productions: Casino Royale (a 1967 spoof starring David Niven) and Never Say Never Again (a 1983 remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, 1965\\'s Thunderball, both starring Connery). The James Bond franchise is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. Casino Royale has also been adapted for television, as a one-hour show in 1954 as part of the CBS series Climax!.\\n\\nThe Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including their soundtracks, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and three wins. Other important elements which run through most of the films include Bond\\'s cars, his guns, and the gadgets with which he is supplied by Q Branch. The films are also noted for Bond\\'s relationships with various women, who are popularly referred to as \"Bond girls\".\\n\\nPublication history\\nCreation and inspiration\\nMain articles: James Bond (literary character) and Inspirations for James Bond\\nIan Fleming created the fictional character of James Bond as the central figure for his works. Bond is an intelligence officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is known by his code number, 007, and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander. Fleming based his fictional creation on a number of individuals he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division and 30 Assault Unit during the Second World War, admitting that Bond \"was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war\".[1] Among those types were his brother, Peter, who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.[2] Aside from Fleming\\'s brother, a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond\\'s make up, including Conrad O\\'Brien-ffrench, Patrick Dalzel-Job, Bill \"Biffy\" Dunderdale and Duško Popov.[1][3]\\n\\nThe name James Bond came from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, a keen birdwatcher himself, had a copy of Bond\\'s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist\\'s wife that \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\".[4] He further explained that:\\n\\nWhen I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.\\n\\n—\\u200aIan Fleming, The New Yorker, 21 April 1962[5]\\nOn another occasion, Fleming said: \"I wanted the simplest, dullest, plainest-sounding name I could find, \\'James Bond\\' was much better than something more interesting, like \\'Peregrine Carruthers\\'. Exotic things would happen to and around him, but he would be a neutral figure—an anonymous, blunt instrument wielded by a government department.\"[6]\\n\\n\\nHoagy Carmichael—Fleming\\'s view of James Bond\\nFleming decided that Bond should resemble both American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself[7] and in Casino Royale, Vesper Lynd remarks, \"Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless.\" Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is \"certainly good-looking ... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold.\"[7]\\n\\nFleming endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs, and using the same brand of toiletries.[8] Bond\\'s tastes are also often taken from Fleming\\'s own as was his behaviour,[9] with Bond\\'s love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming\\'s own. Fleming used his experiences of his career in espionage and all other aspects of his life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.[1]\\n\\nIt was not until the penultimate novel, You Only Live Twice, that Fleming gave Bond a sense of family background. The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr. No in cinemas, and Sean Connery\\'s depiction of Bond affected Fleming\\'s interpretation of the character, henceforth giving Bond both a dry sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories.[10] In a fictional obituary, purportedly published in The Times, Bond\\'s parents were given as Andrew Bond, from the village of Glencoe, Scotland, and Monique Delacroix, from the canton of Vaud, Switzerland.[11] Fleming did not provide Bond\\'s date of birth, but John Pearson\\'s fictional biography of Bond, James Bond: The Authorized Biography of 007, gives Bond a birth date on 11 November 1920,[12] while a study by John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921.[13]\\n\\nNovels and related works\\nMain article: List of James Bond novels and short stories\\nIan Fleming novels\\n\\nGoldeneye, in Jamaica, where Fleming wrote all the Bond novels[14]\\nWhilst serving in the Naval Intelligence Division, Fleming had planned to become an author[15] and had told a friend, \"I am going to write the spy story to end all spy stories.\"[1] On 17 February 1952, he began writing his first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica,[16] where he wrote all his Bond novels during the months of January and February each year.[17] He started the story shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend, Ann Charteris, in order to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials.[18]\\n\\nAfter completing the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed it to his friend (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like it as much.

In 1981, the thriller writer John Gardner picked up the series with Licence Renewed.[37] Gardner went on to write sixteen Bond books in total; two of the books he wrote were novelisations of Eon Productions films of the same name: Licence to Kill and GoldenEye. Gardner moved the Bond series into the 1980s, although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them.[38] In 1996, Gardner retired from writing James Bond books due to ill health.[39]\\n\\n1981 Licence Renewed[40]\\n1982 For Special Services[41]\\n1983 Icebreaker[42]\\n1984 Role of Honour[43]\\n1986 Nobody Lives for Ever[44]\\n1987 No Deals, Mr. Bond[45]\\n1988 Scorpius[46]\\n1989 Win, Lose or Die[47]\\n1989 Licence to Kill[36] (novelisation)\\n1990 Brokenclaw[48]\\n1991 The Man from Barbarossa[49]\\n1992 Death Is Forever[50]\\n1993 Never Send Flowers[51]\\n1994 SeaFire[52]\\n1995 GoldenEye[36] (novelisation)\\n1996 Cold[53]\\nIn 1996, the American author Raymond Benson became the author of the Bond novels.

Trigger Mortis was released on 8 September 2015.[71][72][73] Horowitz\\'s second Bond novel, Forever and a Day, tells the origin story of Bond as a 00 agent prior to the events of Casino Royale. The novel, also based on unpublished material from Fleming, was released on 31 May 2018.[74][75] Horowitz\\'s third Bond novel, With a Mind to Kill, was published on 26 May 2022.[76] Charlie Higson\\'s first adult Bond novel, On His Majesty\\'s Secret Service, was published on 4 May 2023 to celebrate the Coronation of King Charles III and support the National Literacy Trust.[77]\\n\\n2008 Devil May Care\\n2011 Carte Blanche\\n2013 Solo\\n2015 Trigger Mortis\\n2018 Forever and a Day\\n2022 With a Mind to Kill\\n2023 On His Majesty\\'s Secret Service\\nYoung Bond\\nMain article: Young Bond\\nThe Young Bond series of novels was started by Charlie Higson[78] and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published.[79] The first Young Bond novel, SilverFin was also adapted and released as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books.[80] In October 2013 Ian Fleming Publications announced that Stephen Cole would continue the series, with the first edition scheduled to be released in Autumn 2014.[81]\\n\\n2005 SilverFin[82]\\n2006 Blood Fever[83]\\n2007 Double or Die[84]\\n2007 Hurricane Gold[85]\\n2008 By Royal Command[86] & SilverFin[87] (graphic novel)\\n2009 \"A Hard Man to Kill\"[88] (short story)\\nThe Moneypenny Diaries\\nMain article: The Moneypenny Diaries\\nThe Moneypenny Diaries are a trilogy of novels chronicling the life of Miss Moneypenny, M\\'s personal secretary.

The documentary included James Bond in dramatised scenes from Goldfinger—notably featuring 007 being threatened with the novel\\'s circular saw, rather than the film\\'s laser beam—and Diamonds Are Forever.[100] In 1991, a spin-off animated series, James Bond Jr., was produced with Corey Burton in the role of Bond\\'s nephew, James Bond Jr.[101] In 2022, a reality competition show based on the franchise, 007: Road to a Million, was released on Amazon Prime Video.[102]\\n\\nRadio\\nIn 1958, the novel Moonraker was adapted for broadcast on South African radio, with Bob Holness providing the voice of Bond.[103][104] According to The Independent, \"listeners across the Union thrilled to Bob\\'s cultured tones as he defeated evil master criminals in search of world domination\".[105]\\n\\nThe BBC have adapted five of the Fleming novels for broadcast: in 1990 You Only Live Twice was adapted into a 90-minute radio play for BBC Radio 4 with Michael Jayston playing James Bond. The production was repeated a number of times between 2008 and 2011.[106] On 24 May 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast an adaptation of Dr. No. The actor Toby Stephens, who played Bond villain Gustav Graves in the Eon Productions version of Die Another Day, played Bond, while Dr. No was played by David Suchet.[107] Following its success, a second story was adapted and on 3 April 2010 BBC Radio 4 broadcast Goldfinger with Stephens again playing Bond.[108] Sir Ian McKellen was Goldfinger and Stephens\\' Die Another Day co-star Rosamund Pike played Pussy Galore. The play was adapted from Fleming\\'s novel by Archie Scottney and was directed by Martin Jarvis.[109] In 2012, the novel From Russia, with Love was dramatised for Radio 4; it featured a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond.[110] In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond, in On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service, with Alfred Molina as Blofeld, and Joanna Lumley (who appeared in the 1969 film adaptation) as Irma Bunt.[111]\\n\\nComics\\nMain articles: James Bond (comic strip) and James Bond comic books\\n\\nJohn McLusky\\'s rendition of James Bond\\nIn 1957, the Daily Express approached Ian Fleming to adapt his stories into comic strips, offering him £1,500 per novel and a share of takings from syndication.[112] After initial reluctance, Fleming, who felt the strips would lack the quality of his writing, agreed.[113] To aid the Daily Express in illustrating Bond, Fleming commissioned an artist to create a sketch of how he believed James Bond looked. The illustrator, John McLusky, however, felt that Fleming\\'s 007 looked too \"outdated\" and \"pre-war\" and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look.[114] The first strip, Casino Royale was published from 7 July 1958 to 13 December 1958[115] and was written by Anthony Hern and illustrated by John McLusky.[116]\\n\\nMost of the Bond novels and short stories have since been adapted for illustration, as well as Kingsley Amis\\'s Colonel Sun; the works were written by Henry Gammidge or Jim Lawrence (except for the adaptation of Dr. No which was written by future Modesty Blaise creator Peter O\\'Donnell) with Yaroslav Horak replacing McClusky as artist in 1966.[115] After the Fleming and Amis material had been adapted, original stories were produced, continuing in the Daily Express and Sunday Express until May 1977.[114]\\n\\nSeveral comic book adaptations of the James Bond films have been published through the years: at the time of Dr. No\\'s release in October 1962, a comic book adaptation of the screenplay, written by Norman J. Nodel, was published in Britain as part of the Classics Illustrated anthology series.[117] It was later reprinted in the United States by DC Comics as part of its Showcase anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).[118][117]\\n\\nWith the release of the 1981 film For Your Eyes Only, Marvel Comics published a two-issue comic book adaptation of the film.[119][120] When Octopussy was released in the cinemas in 1983, Marvel published an accompanying comic;[117] Eclipse also produced a one-off comic for Licence to Kill, although Timothy Dalton refused to allow his likeness to be used.[121] New Bond stories were also drawn up and published from 1989 onwards through Marvel, Eclipse Comics, Dark Horse Comics and Dynamite Entertainment.[117][120][122]\\n\\n\\nFranchise logo, 1995–present\\nEon Productions, the company of Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli, released the first cinema adaptation of an Ian Fleming novel, Dr. No (1962), based on the eponymous 1958 novel and featuring Sean Connery as 007.[123] Connery starred in a further four films before leaving the role after You Only Live Twice (1967),[124] which was taken up by George Lazenby for On Her Majesty\\'s Secret Service (1969).[125] Lazenby left the role after just one appearance and Connery was brought back for his last Eon-produced film Diamonds Are Forever.[126]\\n\\nRoger Moore was appointed to the role of 007 for Live and Let Die (1973). He played Bond a further six times over twelve years, before being replaced by Timothy Dalton for two films. After a six-year hiatus, during which a legal wrangle threatened Eon\\'s productions of the Bond films,[127] Irish actor Pierce Brosnan was cast as Bond in GoldenEye (1995); he remained in the role for a total of four films through 2002. In 2006, Daniel Craig was given the role for Casino Royale (2006), which rebooted the series.[128] Craig appeared for a total of five films.[129] The series has grossed well over $7 billion to date, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film series.[130]'"

            "In the field of machine learning, a model is trained on a dataset and then tested on new, unseen data. The goal is to make accurate predictions on this new data. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data. A good model should strike a balance between complexity and simplicity to achieve good performance on both the training and new data. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by splitting the dataset into multiple parts and training and testing the model on different combinations of these parts.\n",

Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and does not capture the underlying patterns in the data. A good model should strike a balance between complexity and simplicity to achieve good performance on both the training and new data. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by splitting the dataset into multiple parts and training and testing the model on different combinations of these parts.\\n```\\n[\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"machine learning\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"model\",\\n\"edge\": \"involves\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"model\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"dataset\",\\n\"edge\": \"trained\\\\_on\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"model\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"new\\\\_data\",\\n\"edge\": \"tested\\\\_on\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"model\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"accurate\\\\_predictions\",\\n\"edge\": \"makes\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"model\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"overfitting\",\\n\"edge\": \"avoids\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"overfitting\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"complexity\",\\n\"edge\": \"results\\\\_from\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"overfitting\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"poor\\\\_performance\",\\n\"edge\": \"causes\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"model\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"underfitting\",\\n\"edge\": \"avoids\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"underfitting\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"simplicity\",\\n\"edge\": \"results\\\\_from\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"model\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"balance\",\\n\"edge\": \"strikes\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"balance\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"complexity\\\\_simplicity\",\\n\"edge\": \"between\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"cross-validation\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"technique\",\\n\"edge\": \"is\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"cross-validation\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"model\",\\n\"edge\": \"assesses\\\\_performance\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"cross-validation\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"dataset\",\\n\"edge\": \"splits\"\\n},\\n{\\n\"node\\\\_1\": \"dataset\",\\n\"node\\\\_2\": \"multiple\\\\_parts\",\\n\"edge\": \"split\\\\_into\"\\n}\\n]',\n",
